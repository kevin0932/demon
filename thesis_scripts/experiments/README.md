# Pre-processing
For all the experiments, DeMoN predictions should be made and saved locally so that predictions can be retrieved later whenever you want according to different settings. Thus, again, we need to run scripts to resize and adjust the intrinsics of input images. The results will be saved in .h5 files.

* DeMoN_resize_input_images_intrinsicsAdjusted.py
* DeMoN_prediction_to_h5_filter_pairs.py
